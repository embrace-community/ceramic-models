# Use Models in a project

## Compile the composite runtime

Up until now we have only created the models and deployed them to the Ceramic node. In order to use the models in a project we need to compile the composite runtime. This is done by running the following command:

    composedb composite:compile composites/Merged.json runtime/Runtime.json
    composedb composite:compile composites/Merged.json runtime/Runtime.ts

The runtime can be a TypeScript, JSON or JavaScript file. The GraphQL Server that is built into compose-db requires a JSON runtime, the Apollo Frontend requires a TypeScript runtime.

## Create a GraphQL Server

The quickest way to work with the created schema is to use the GraphQL server that comes with the Ceramic node. This can be started by running the following command:

    composedb graphql:server --graphiql runtime/Runtime.json --did-private-key $(cat priv.key)

## Implementing in a project

This runtime file can also be used in a project to create, update and query the data in the database. For example it can be imported into an Apollo Server project and used to create a GraphQL API.
[Apollo Example](https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.3.x/guides/interacting/using-apollo)

    import { ApolloClient, ApolloLink, InMemoryCache, Observable } from '@apollo/client'
    import { ComposeClient } from '@composedb/client'

    // Path to the generated runtime composite definition
    import { definition } from './**generated**/definition.js'

    const compose = new ComposeClient({ ceramic: 'http://localhost:7007', definition })

    // Create a custom ApolloLink using the ComposeClient instance to execute operations
    const link = new ApolloLink((operation) => {
            return new Observable((observer) => {
                compose.execute(operation.query, operation.variables).then(
                (result) => {
                    observer.next(result)
                    observer.complete()
                },
                (error) => {
                    observer.error(error)
                }
            )
        })
    })

    // Use the created ApolloLink instance in your ApolloClient configuration
    export const client = new ApolloClient({ cache: new InMemoryCache(), link })
